Small web application game written in Javascript and CSS. 

Clicking on one of the coloured diamonds moves it one step to the right, from the start line to the finish line. 
Once a diamond has moved 10 steps, it is the winner and clicking no longer triggers a response for any of the diamonds. 
The current scores are indicated on the score board.
